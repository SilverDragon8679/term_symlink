**Description:

The Term Symlink module lets users to assign some term to be a "symbolic link"
of another term.

Suppose we need Photographers term to be a child of both Services and
Job Seekers terms. We can make Photographers a child of Job Seekers, then
create new term Photo as a child of Services and assign Photo as symbolic
link of Photographers. Then:

1. When a visitor clicks on Photo term link he will be redirected to
Photographers.
2. When an editor adds Photo term to a node, the Photographers will be
assigned. So, Photographers is usual term and Photo is virtual,
that can not correspond any node but redirects all requests to Photographers.

A term may have one or more symbolic links.

I understand, the module name "Term Symlink" isn't aptest.
